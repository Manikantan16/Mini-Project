### Evaluation of Data Analytics Course Sessions - MiniCapstone Project
- Its a Mini Capstone Project to Analyse the Data Analytics Classes.
- Classes commenced on 16th October and ended on 15 Feb so took the insights and visualized the data using different tools such as:<br/> 
  - **MySql**<br/> 
  - **PowerBi Desktop** <br/> 
  - **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** <br/> 
 - Created an excel and drilled down / categorized the classes based on various factors such as:<br/>
     - **Working Days (W)**  - Classes held on regular week days.<br/>
     - **Class Test  (CT)** - Online Tests conducted during the course.<br/>
     - **Weekly Off  (WO)** - Week Ends (2nd,4th Saturday) and all sundays, during which no classes were held.<br/>
     - **Public Holiday (PH)** - Days designated as Public Holidays (Deepawali,Christmas,New Year eve, Pongal).<br/>
     - **Sick Leave  (SL)**  - Instances where classes were cancelled due to trainers illness.<br/>
  - The first 2 categories (W,CT) are considered as **Classes/Class Days**, while the last 3 (WO,PH,SL) are categorized as **No Classes / Non-Class Days**. 
 - **MYSQL**:
      - Created an excel file with 6 sheets and converted it to csv and imported the csv data to Mysql table and wrote query for the displaying the results
      - Log in to Mysql Workbench and Select the Desired Database
      - In the Navigator panel on the left, locate your database and the table into which you want to import the data.
      - Right click tables and select **Table Data Import Wizard**

      - Select your Excel file (saved as .csv format) and click Open
      - In the Import Wizard, a window will pop up asking you to select the file you want to import

      - Map Columns (if needed)
      - You can match the columns from the CSV to the columns in your MySQL table. Usually, it will auto-detect the columns, but you can manually adjust them if              needed
      - Once youâ€™ve set everything up, click Next and then Finish to start the import process.
      - Once done you can check by executing the below query:<br/>
        SELECT * FROM table_name;
      - In my Case the selected queries are:<br/>
        select * from nit.Da_classes<br/>
        Select * from nit.Day_Type<br/>
        Select distinct Day_Type from  nit.Da_classes<br/>
  
        - Evaluate or Review the Classes held in October 2024.

        - For example, if we want to view the Class details from 01-Jan-2025 wards, we can use the stored procedure to filter the data accordingly.<br/>
          CALL GetClassDetailsByParams('2025-01-01','','');

    - **Power-BI**:
      - Imported the csv file and created the insights using measures, cards etc
      - Implemented the Demographics i.e Day Type distribution for the Entire class duration using Clustered Column Chart.
      - Day Type Count by Month wise (Oct - Feb) using Stacked bar chart
      - Breakup of days by Month for entire class using Donut Charts.

      - **Python(Pandas and Matplotlib in JupyterNotebook)**:
        -  using pandas imported the various sheets of excel and used merge functions and showed the results.
        -  using matplotlib implemented few graphs.

- To Conclude, The Data Analytics Class Analysis has been implemented across various applications viz MySQL, Python, and Power BI.
